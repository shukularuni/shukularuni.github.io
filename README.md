### im gonna make this a blog hehe (dd/mm/yy)

**10/11/24 -** might do this tomorrow, kinda tired rn

**11/11/24 -** this is a repository for my website where i'll be posting all of the stuff, like the guides, i mean writeups, etc.

**18/04/24 -** i just realised i can use git to change a million things per commit, so i don't need to wait a minute between changing something in every freaking file on this repository YAY. but i will not do this, not until the 25th i think, because im in canada as vacation rn and dont got my laptop, yeah making writeups from my ipad is horrible, i had to do a wget command by hand yesterday, but yeah idk, also im making this readme file to be a small blog of some sort yeah i dont know where else to put this okay byebye :3

**19/04/24 -** also, i was gonna do some web exploitation stuff, using internet archive as a way to save the images of the challenge's procedures, but i realised again, i still don't have my laptop, so yeah those will have to wait a couple days. also today is not the 19th but i just wanted to say that rn i dont care bye bye :3:3
