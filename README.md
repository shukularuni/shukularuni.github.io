### im gonna make this a blog hehe (dd/mm/yy)

**10/11/24 -** might do this tomorrow, kinda tired rn

**11/11/24 -** this is a repository for my website where i'll be posting all of the stuff, like the guides, i mean writeups, etc.

**18/04/25 -** i just realised i can use git to change a million things per commit, so i don't need to wait a minute between changing something in every freaking file on this repository YAY. but i will not do this, not until the 25th i think, because im in canada as vacation rn and dont got my laptop, yeah making writeups from my ipad is horrible, i had to do a wget command by hand yesterday, but yeah idk, also im making this readme file to be a small blog of some sort yeah i dont know where else to put this okay byebye :3

**19/04/25 -** also, i was gonna do some web exploitation stuff, using internet archive as a way to save the images of the challenge's procedures, but i realised again, i still don't have my laptop, so yeah those will have to wait a couple days. also today is not the 19th but i just wanted to say that rn i dont care bye bye :3:3

**14/05/25 -** as youve probably noticed by me not having done a thing in a couple weeks, i have exam week like next week, so yeah not much these next few weeks, damn ive said the word week too much, anyway, i was gonna make this announcement a few weeks ago, but forgot, so yeah biebie:3:3:3

**20/12/25 -** soooooo, okay, i haven't been active for like half a year... uhh yeah sorry about that, i've been having a lot of side quests like having to finish highschool, and having so many stress problems made me unable to work on this stuff, also i was even more delayed because of my laptop, or well BitLocker on my windows laptop, look i have no idea why, it might have been a faulty update or some false positive, but BitLocker just felt like my computer was being attacked or something, i mean that's the programs job, but it did make me really mad because this appendix ahh program literally nuked my computer and encrypted the whole freaking drive, i know it like asks for a recovery key, but try as i might i coudn't find it anywhere, not in my microsoft accounts, not in any of the 20 USBs i have, nowhere to be found. and then it hit me, i probably deleted the file to save a little space! because for some reason i have the tendency to delete random text files that are old and don't really matter to me. so anyways, my 3 years ago self was really dumb for not backing up this really important file containing a key to recover my most important files, well there wasn't much of a loss most of the things apart from a hundred drm free games that i'm working to get back, a bunch of passwords, some important programs, and about 40 guides for this website, don't worry about me&mdash;already went through all stages of grief already. although i did have like half on a backup i did on an external USB. so yeah, i don't want that to happen again, so i reinstalled windows clearing the entire encrypted drive, and installed ubuntu alongside windows for a dual boot (i only use windows for the games, so i partitioned the drive to give windows just 128gb). cool bye =3
