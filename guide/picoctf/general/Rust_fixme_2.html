            <h2>Theory</h2>
            <p>According to the description, to get the flag we to download some rust code, and fix the errors. Before doing that, comes the hard part, setting up rust. I used Replit, which is a platform to run many programming languages online, including rust, and believe me, I tried installing rust at first, but was met with a lot of dead ends, downloaded 4.5 gigabytes of content, and didn't really get to actually run it, so I just used Replit, which everything is already set up, and I just had to paste the code and libraries (which it downloads automatically) from the tar file. And when you create the project, it's instantly public, which I am so sorry, but I missed that for the entire competition, I literally had the rust codes public on my Replit already solved and with the flags on it, so I could've been disqualified, but luckily nobody noticed my mistake, which you can find <a target="_blank" href="https://archive.org/download/sh_w_imgstff_fgunp/picoctf/Rust_fixme_2/">here</a>, just ignore the name of the repl. Anyways, onto the actual challenge.</p>
            <h2>Solution</h2>
            <p>First let's paste our code:</p>
            <pre>use xor_cryptor::XORCryptor;

fn decrypt(encrypted_buffer:Vec&lt;u8&gt;, borrowed_string: &amp;String){ // How do we pass values to a function that we want to change?

    // Key for decryption
    let key = String::from("CSUCKS");

    // Editing our borrowed value
    borrowed_string.push_str("PARTY FOUL! Here is your flag: ");

    // Create decrpytion object
    let res = XORCryptor::new(&amp;key);
    if res.is_err() {
        return; // How do we return in rust?
    }
    let xrc = res.unwrap();

    // Decrypt flag and print it out
    let decrypted_buffer = xrc.decrypt_vec(encrypted_buffer);
    borrowed_string.push_str(&amp;String::from_utf8_lossy(&amp;decrypted_buffer));
    println!("{}", borrowed_string);
}


fn main() {
    // Encrypted flag values
    let hex_values = ["41", "30", "20", "63", "4a", "45", "54", "76", "01", "1c", "7e", "59", "63", "e1", "61", "25", "0d", "c4", "60", "f2", "12", "a0", "18", "03", "51", "03", "36", "05", "0e", "f9", "42", "5b"];

    // Convert the hexadecimal strings to bytes and collect them into a vector
    let encrypted_buffer: Vec&lt;u8&gt; = hex_values.iter()
        .map(|&amp;hex| u8::from_str_radix(hex, 16).unwrap())
        .collect();

    let party_foul = String::from("Using memory unsafe languages is a: "); // Is this variable changeable?
    decrypt(encrypted_buffer, &amp;party_foul); // Is this the correct way to pass a value to a function so that it can be changed?
}</pre>
            <p>So right off the bat, we can see that there are four comments highlighting the four errors in the code. How do we pass values to a function that we want to change? With a mutation to `borrowed_string`. How do we return in rust? That `return;` is already correct wtf. Is this variable changeable? Yes, so make it mutable. Is this the correct way to pass a value to a function so that it can be changed? No, it also has to be mutable. Also I'm gonna remove all the comments for no reason at all:</p>
            <pre>use xor_cryptor::XORCryptor;

fn decrypt(encrypted_buffer: Vec&lt;u8&gt;, borrowed_string: &amp;mut String) {
    let key = String::from("CSUCKS");

    borrowed_string.push_str("PARTY FOUL! Here is your flag: ");

    let res = XORCryptor::new(&amp;key);
    if res.is_err() {
        return;
    }
    let xrc = res.unwrap();

    let decrypted_buffer = xrc.decrypt_vec(encrypted_buffer);
    borrowed_string.push_str(&amp;String::from_utf8_lossy(&amp;decrypted_buffer));
    println!("{}", borrowed_string);
}

fn main() {
    let hex_values = ["41", "30", "20", "63", "4a", "45", "54", "76", "01", "1c", "7e", "59", "63", "e1", "61", "25", "0d", "c4", "60", "f2", "12", "a0", "18", "03", "51", "03", "36", "05", "0e", "f9", "42", "5b"];

    let encrypted_buffer: Vec&lt;u8&gt; = hex_values.iter()
        .map(|&amp;hex| u8::from_str_radix(hex, 16).unwrap())
        .collect();

    let mut party_foul = String::from("Using memory unsafe languages is a: ");
    decrypt(encrypted_buffer, &amp;mut party_foul);
}</pre>
            <p>And when we run this code:</p>
            <pre>    Blocking waiting for file lock on package cache

            <p>There we go! That's the flag.</p>
            <p>I rated this level as "good"! :3</p>
