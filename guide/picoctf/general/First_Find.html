            <h2>First Find</h2>
            <pre>Name: First Find
Description: Unzip this archive and find the file named 'uber-secret.txt' Download zip file

            <h2>Theory</h2>
            <p>According to the description, to get the flag we have to search for a file called uber-secret, which i don't really know how to do, so I'll try doing the same thing as Big Zip, and find recursively through all files in all folders of the zip. Just use grep with the recursive option, looking for the flag, with an asterisk to look through all the folders in whatever the zip folder is called:</p>
            <pre>grep -R "picoCTF{" first-find-folder-name/*</pre>
            <h2>Solution</h2>
            <p>First, let's just get the zip, open it, and place ourselves inside:</p>

            <p>And wait, that was unexpected, I guess we won't need to find recursively, because when unzipping, it shows all the files and folders being extracted from it, so it literally says where uber-secret is located, just need to copy the file name and cat to get the flag:</p>
            <pre>shukularuni-picoctf@webshell:~$ cat files/adequate_books/more_books/.secret/deeper_secrets/deepest_secrets/uber-secret.txt
picoCTF{f1nd_15_f457_ab443fd1}</pre>
            <p>There we go! That's the flag.</p>
            <p>I rated this level as "good"! :3</p>
