            <pre>Name: Magikarp Ground Mission
Description: Do you know how to move between directories and read files in the shell? Start the container, `ssh` to it, and then `ls` once connected to begin. Login via `ssh` as `ctf-player` with the password, `6dee9772` - SSH  ssh ctf-player@venus.picoctf.net -p 58783

Hints:
1. Finding a cheatsheet for bash would be really helpful!</pre>
            <h2>Theory</h2>
            <p>According to the description, to get the flag we have to enter to an SSH directory and go through different folders and whatnot, so yeah, kind of everything we can get out of it, let's see inside that SSH.</p>
            <h2>Solution</h2>
            <p>First let's enter the SSH:</p>
            <pre>C:\Users\ssh ctf-player@venus.picoctf.net -p 58783
The authenticity of host '[venus.picoctf.net]:58783 ([3.131.124.143]:58783)' can't be established.
ED25519 key fingerprint is SHA256:P1f6h95BrSVnJbm2AKhphfHHGEyAeThib/rN/AwKs24.
This host key is known by the following other names/addresses:
    ~/.ssh/known_hosts:5: [venus.picoctf.net]:58697
    ~/.ssh/known_hosts:8: [venus.picoctf.net]:58741
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])? yes
Warning: Permanently added '[venus.picoctf.net]:58783' (ED25519) to the list of known hosts.
ctf-player@venus.picoctf.net's password: 6dee9772

ctf-player@pico-chall$ ls
1of3.flag.txt  instructions-to-2of3.txt

ctf-player@pico-chall$ cat *
picoCTF{xxsh_
Next, go to the root of all things, more succinctly `/`</pre>
            <p>Ok, I see where this is going, we're just gonna go around looking for the parts of the flag:</p>
            <pre>ctf-player@pico-chall$ cd /

ctf-player@pico-chall$ ls
2of3.flag.txt  bin  boot  dev  etc  home  instructions-to-3of3.txt  lib  lib64  media  mnt  opt  proc  root  run  sbin  srv  sys  tmp  usr  var

ctf-player@pico-chall$ cat 2* i*
0ut_0f_\/\/4t3r_
Lastly, ctf-player, go home... more succinctly `~`

ctf-player@pico-chall$ cd ~

ctf-player@pico-chall$ ls
3of3.flag.txt  drop-in

ctf-player@pico-chall$ cat 3*
540e4e79}</pre>
            <p>Also, what is that drop-in? It's where we started when entering to the SSH, now we can exit too off the SSH:</p>
            <pre>ctf-player@pico-chall$ ls drop-in
1of3.flag.txt  instructions-to-2of3.txt

ctf-player@pico-chall$ exit
logout
Connection to venus.picoctf.net closed.</pre>
            <p>So if we join all of the parts of the flag, we get this:</p>
            <pre>picoCTF{xxsh_0ut_0f_\/\/4t3r_540e4e79}</pre>
            <p>There we go! That's the flag.</p>
            <p>I rated this level as "good"! :3</p>
