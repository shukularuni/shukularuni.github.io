Hints:
1. Submit your answer in our flag format. For example, if your answer was 'hello', you would submit 'picoCTF{hello}' as the flag.</pre>
            <h2>Theory</h2>
            <p>According to the description, to get the flag we have to convert that weird string of text that looks oddly like Base64, back to text and submit it. I think it's Base64 because even if it doesn't have the usual equal sign at the end (= or ==) it does have the same set of letters both upper and lower case, and the structure just looks really like it would on a Base64 string. So let's go decode it in Base64 to see if it's really that.</p>
            <h2>Solution</h2>
            <p>Let's check by decoding from Base64:</p>
            <pre>BASE64 DECODE (Base64Decode.com)

INPUT: bDNhcm5fdGgzX3IwcDM1

OUTPUT: l3arn_th3_r0p35</pre>
            <p>Great, it was really Base64, now let's put it in the usual pico flag format and submit it:</p>
            <pre>Submit Flag: picoCTF{l3arn_th3_r0p35}

Check: Correct!</pre>
            <p>There we go! That's the flag.</p>
            <p>I rated this level as "good"! :3</p>
