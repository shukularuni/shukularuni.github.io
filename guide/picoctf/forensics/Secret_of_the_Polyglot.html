            <h2>Secret of the Polyglot</h2>
            <pre>Name: The Network Operations Center (NOC) of your local institution picked up a suspicious file, they're getting conflicting information on what type of file it is. They've brought you in as an external expert to examine the file. Can you extract all the information from this strange file? Download the suspicious file here.

Challenge from: picoCTF 2024
Files: flag2of2-final.pdf
Hints:
1. This problem can be solved by just opening the file in different ways</pre>
            <h2>Theory</h2>
            <p>According to the description, to get the flag we have to "open a file in different ways". Huh. So we only get that pdf file, we'll see what it is later, but it says 2 of 2, so that means it's the second half of the flag. I don't want to spoil much because this is a fun challenge, but in the tags it says file_format, so that means the file is going to be a different format, but how? Maybe we could use file to know what it is, but if it's really different file formats inside of a single file, then maybe that'll confuse the machine or something? Idk, I'll upload it to VirusTotal because that's what I do with every file I find that I have no clue what it does or idk I just do because it's fun I guess. But enough of that! Let's just upload that to VT and see what happens.</p>
            <h2>Solution</h2>
            <p>So if we upload it, we get:</p>
            <pre>0/63 undetected malicious

            <p>No way, It's a png file! Let's change the file extension and see what it is:</p>
            <img src="https://archive.org/download/sh_w_imgstff_fgunp/picoctf/Secret_of_the_Polyglot/1of2.png">
            <p>Ok, that seems like the first half of the flag, now let's see the pdf:</p>
            <img src="https://archive.org/download/sh_w_imgstff_fgunp/picoctf/Secret_of_the_Polyglot/2of2_page.jpg" style="height:420px">
            <p>Now let's just write what the image says and copy the text from the pdf, and join them, so we get this:</p>
            <pre>picoCTF{f1u3n7_1n_pn9_&_pdf_90974127}</pre>
            <p>There we go! That's the flag.</p>
            <p>I rated this level as "good"! :3</p>
