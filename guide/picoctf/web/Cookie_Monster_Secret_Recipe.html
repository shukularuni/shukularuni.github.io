Hints:
1. Sometimes, the most important information is hidden in plain sight. Have you checked all parts of the webpage?
2. Cookies aren't just for eating - they're also used in web technologies!
3. Web browsers often have tools that can help you inspect various aspects of a webpage, including things you can't see directly.</pre>
            <h2>Theory</h2>
            <p>According to the description, to get the flag we have to retrieve some important cookies from the cookie monster or something like that. So let's go to the webpage.</p>
            <h2>Solution</h2>
            <p>So we'll open the website:</p>
            <img src="https://archive.org/download/sh_w_imgstff_fgunp/picoctf/Cookie_Monster_Secret_Recipe/1.png">
            <p>Oh a log in, I really don't know what the credentials might be, so let's just put admin, and enter:</p>
            <img src="https://archive.org/download/sh_w_imgstff_fgunp/picoctf/Cookie_Monster_Secret_Recipe/2.png">
            <p>Okay that makes total sense, they don't need us to log in they just like cookies so much, they risked their entire system's  security just for cookie liking, great. So now let's go to the cookies, and yup there is something here:</p>
            <img src="https://archive.org/download/sh_w_imgstff_fgunp/picoctf/Cookie_Monster_Secret_Recipe/3.png">
            <p>That looks like some Base64, let's decode it with the website I always use:</p>
            <pre>BASE64 DECODE (Base64Decode.com)

INPUT: cGljb0NURntjMDBrMWVfbTBuc3Rlcl9sMHZlc19jMDBraWVzXzZDMkZCN0YzfQ==

OUTPUT: picoCTF{c00k1e_m0nster_l0ves_c00kies_6C2FB7F3}</pre>
            <p>There we go! That's the flag.</p>
            <p>I rated this level as "good"! :3</p>
