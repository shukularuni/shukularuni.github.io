Author: syreal
Tags: Easy, General Skills, picoCTF 2021
Challenge from: picoCTF 2021
Files: flag
Hints:
1. Any hints about entering a command into the Terminal (such as the next one), will start with a '$'... everything after the dollar sign will be typed (or copy and pasted) into your Terminal.
2. To get the file accessible in your shell, enter the following in the Terminal prompt: $ wget https://mercury.picoctf.net/static/2d24d50b4ebed90c704575627f1f57b2/flag
3. $ man cat</pre>
            <h2>Theory</h2>
            <p>According to the description, to get the flag we have to open a file they gave us, I don't think it will be as easy as just opening the file, it will probably be encoding in some weird thing or whatever. Let's see what the file has.</p>
            <h2>Solution</h2>
            <p>And, no. It is really as easy as opening the file, because downloading it and opening it, gives us this:</p>
            <pre>shukularuni-picoctf@webshell:~$ cat flag
picoCTF{s4n1ty_v3r1f13d_f28ac910}</pre>
            <p>There we go! That's the flag.</p>
            <p>I rated this level as "good"! :3</p>
