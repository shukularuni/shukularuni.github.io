            <h2>Glitch Cat</h2>
            <pre>Name: Glitch Cat
Description: Our flag printing service has started glitching! $ nc saturn.picoctf.net 51392

Challenge from: Beginner picoMini 2022
Hints:
1. ASCII is one of the most common encodings used in programming
2. We know that the glitch output is valid Python, somehow!
3. Press Ctrl and c on your keyboard to close your connection and return to the command prompt.</pre>
            <h2>Theory</h2>
            <p>According to the description, to get the flag we'll need to fix some code or something, since they've told us the flag printing program isn't working correctly.</p>
            <h2>Solution</h2>
            <p>We just need to enter the NetCat, and see what's going on:</p>
            <pre>shukularuni-picoctf@webshell:~$ nc saturn.picoctf.net 51392
'picoCTF{gl17ch_m3_n07_' + chr(0x61) + chr(0x34) + chr(0x33) + chr(0x39) + chr(0x32) + chr(0x64) + chr(0x32) + chr(0x65) + '}'</pre>
            <p>So it seems that instead of printing the actual flag, it's printing the character command for each character in that part of the flag, so we can just run that on a python print, and should get the correct flag:</p>
            <pre>print('picoCTF{gl17ch_m3_n07_' + chr(0x61) + chr(0x34) + chr(0x33) + chr(0x39) + chr(0x32) + chr(0x64) + chr(0x32) + chr(0x65) + '}')

picoCTF{gl17ch_m3_n07_a4392d2e}</pre>
            <p>There we go! That's the flag.</p>
            <p>I rated this level as "good"! :3</p>
