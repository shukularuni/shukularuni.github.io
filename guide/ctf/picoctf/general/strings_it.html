Description: Can you find the flag in file without running it?

            <h2>Theory</h2>
            <p>According to the description, to get the flag we have to use the strings command to find something in that file, I don't think there might be anything else to it, since it's an easy challenge.</p>
            <h2>Solution</h2>
            <p>First, let's download the file and change the name because running `strings strings` will be a little confusing, also this looks like it's an executable:</p>
            <pre>shukularuni-picoctf@webshell:~$ wget https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/static/fae9ac5267cd6e44124e559b901df177/strings

shukularuni-picoctf@webshell:~$ mv strings name.yay

shukularuni-picoctf@webshell:~$ chmod +x name.yay

shukularuni-picoctf@webshell:~$ ./name.yay
Maybe try the 'strings' function? Take a look at the man page</pre>
            <p>Okay, and because it's a really large file, I don't think it'll be a good idea to just use strings by itself, because it will spit out every human readable character, and this file contains a lot of that. So, we'll pipe the result to a grep to find all instances if not the one where the flag appears by searching for its format:</p>
            <pre>shukularuni-picoctf@webshell:~$ strings name.yay | grep "picoCTF{"
picoCTF{5tRIng5_1T_7f766a23}</pre>
            <p>There we go! That's the flag.</p>
            <p>I rated this level as "good"! :3</p>
