            <pre>Name: Static ain't always noise
Description: Can you look at the data in this binary: static? This BASH script might help!

Challenge from: picoCTF 2021
Files: static, ltdis.sh</pre>
            <h2>Theory</h2>
            <p>According to the description, to get the flag we have to use a bash script to look at some binary data. We'll see how that works by downloading and printing the content of that bash script file. It seems to be a dissasembler, probably for the other file.</p>
            <h2>Solution</h2>
            <p>First give it permission to be executed and let's see what the program does:</p>
            <pre>shukularuni-picoctf@webshell:~$ chmod +x ltdis.sh

shukularuni-picoctf@webshell:~$ chmod +x static

shukularuni-picoctf@webshell:~$ ./static
Oh hai! Wait what? A flag? Yes, it's around here somewhere!</pre>
            <p>So we have to look somewhere inside the program, let's see what that dissasembler does:</p>
            <pre>shukularuni-picoctf@webshell:~$ ./ltdis.sh static
Attempting disassembly of static ...
Disassembly successful! Available at: static. ltdis.x86_64.txt
Ripping strings from binary with file offsets...
Any strings found in static have been written to static.ltdis.strings.txt with file offset</pre>
            <p>It seems it used strings to get all the text inside the program, so instead of printing out the entire thing it wrote in a file, let's use grep to find the flag:</p>
            <pre>shukularuni-picoctf@webshell:~$ cat static.ltdis.strings.txt | grep "picoCTF{"
   1020 picoCTF{d15a5m_t34s3r_98d35619}</pre>
            <p>There we go! That's the flag.</p>
            <p>I rated this level as "good"! :3</p>
