            <h2>hashcrack</h2>
            <pre>Name: hashcrack
Description: A company stored a secret message on a server which got breached due to the admin using weakly hashed passwords. Can you gain access to the secret stored within the server? Access the server using nc verbal-sleep.picoctf.net 51759

Challenge from: picoCTF 2025
Hints:
1. Understanding hashes is very crucial. <a target="_blank" href="https://primer.picoctf.org/#_hashing">Read more here</a>.
2. Can you identify the hash algorithm? Look carefully at the length and structure of each hash identified.
3. Tried using any hash cracking tools?</pre>
            <h2>Theory</h2>
            <p>According to the description, to get the flag, I think we might have to crack hashes, and for that there is a really cool website called CrackStation, that has hashes of the most simple and popular passwords that exist, so I guess it's a good source we can have for this challenge. So yeah, that's about everything we can get from the challenge information, so let's go and enter to the NetCat.</p>
            <h2>Solution</h2>
            <p>Enter to the NetCat from the description:</p>
            <pre>shukularuni-picoctf@webshell:~$ nc verbal-sleep.picoctf.net 51759
Welcome!! Looking For the Secret?

We have identified a hash: 482c811da5d5b4bc6d497ffa98491e38
Enter the password for identified hash:</pre>
            <p>Great! An MD5 hash, let's send that to CrackStation and see what kind of password it is:</p>
            <img src="https://archive.org/download/sh_w_imgstff_fgunp/picoctf/hashcrack/1.png">
            <pre>Enter the password for identified hash: password123
Correct! You've cracked the MD5 hash with no secret found!

Flag is yet to be revealed!! Crack this hash: b7a875fc1ea228b9061041b7cec4bd3c52ab3ce3
Enter the password for the identified hash:</pre>
            <p>Now that's SHA1, we don't have to change anything, as CrackStation already does that for us:</p>
            <img src="https://archive.org/download/sh_w_imgstff_fgunp/picoctf/hashcrack/2.png">
            <pre>Enter the password for the identified hash: letmein
Correct! You've cracked the SHA-1 hash with no secret found!

Almost there!! Crack this hash: 916e8c4f79b25028c9e467f1eb8eee6d6bbdff965f9928310ad30a8d88697745
Enter the password for the identified hash:</pre>
            <p>Almost there? Alright let's finish this by sending the SHA256 to CrackStation:</p>
            <img src="https://archive.org/download/sh_w_imgstff_fgunp/picoctf/hashcrack/3.png">
            <pre>Enter the password for the identified hash: qwerty098
Correct! You've cracked the SHA-256 hash with a secret found. 
The flag is: picoCTF{UseStr0nG_h@shEs_&PaSswDs!_ce730f64}</pre>
            <p>There we go! That's the flag.</p>
            <p>I rated this level as "good"! :3</p>
