Hints:
1. Don't be fooled by the visible text; it's just a decoy!
2. Look beyond the surface for hidden clues</pre>
            <h2>Theory</h2>
            <p>According to the description, to get the flag we have to find some hidden message inside this PDF file, we should download the file first, then use the poppler-utils app that gives us the pdftotext command, so that we can get all the text on the PDF file, because when I opened the PDF it had a couple of redacted details, so we'll check that. So let's first download the file.</p>
            <h2>Solution</h2>
            <p>Let's download the PDF file and see what text it has in it:</p>

Title: The Ultimate Guide to Flag Hunting
Welcome to the challenge!
Don't worry, this might look like gibberish, but maybe there's something hidden somewhere? I
spent so much time creating this PDF with care... or maybe not!

Here's a Quick Story:
Once upon a time, in a land far, far away, there was a secret... But where could it be? Hidden
deep within the document? Maybe the text holds clues?
Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Integer posuere erat a ante venenatis
dapibus posuere velit aliquet. Aenean lacinia bibendum nulla sed consectetur. Fusce dapibus,
tellus ac cursus commodo, tortor mauris condimentum nibh, ut fermentum massa justo sit amet
risus. Curabitur blandit tempus porttitor. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.
You thought this was important? Nah, it's just random text. Keep looking. Or maybe, just
maybe, you're in the wrong place?

Special Hidden Section:
The author have done a great and good job
Don't bother trying to reveal the hidden text, it's just nonsense anyway. Even if you somehow
manage to do it, all you'll get is:
No flag here. Nice try though!

If you're still reading this, I'll tell you a secret: the answer might not be here after all...

Good luck! You'll need it!</pre>
            <p>Okay, so it seems even though there is "redacted" text on the document, there really isn't anything special on it. So let's check deeper like the hints told us, so instead let's check the metadata of the file:</p>
