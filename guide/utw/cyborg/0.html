            <h2>Access</h2>
            <p>SSH: <code>ssh cyborg1@cyborg.underthewire.tech -p 22</code></p>
            <p>Password: <code>cyborg1</code></p>
            <h2>Info</h2>
            <pre>The password for cyborg2 is the state that the user Chris Rogers is from as stated within Active Directory.

NOTE:
– The password will be lowercase no matter how it appears on the screen.
– “State” refers to the location within the country and NOT the “state” of the account (enabled/ disabled).

IMPORTANT:
Once you feel you have completed the Cyborg1 challenge, start a new connection to the server, and log in with the username of Cyborg2 and this password will be the answer from Cyborg1. If successful, close out the Cyborg1 connection and begin to solve the Cyborg2 challenge. This concept is repeated over and over until you reach the end of the game.

List the available modules, there may be a useful one available…</pre>
            <h2>Theory</h2>
            <p>To enter the game we first have to know how to use SSH, which if you don't, it's basically a tool to enter another machine's shell and do stuff while connected there. Kind of. We'll use this command that connects to the user cyborg1 in the domain of cyborg.underthewire.tech with port 22:</p>
            <pre>ssh cyborg1@cyborg.underthewire.tech -p 22</pre>
            <h2>Solution</h2>
            <p>Now all we need is to get the password, which as how it says in the description, it's on their slack community on the starthere channel. Which if we go to, we can see all the logins for the website in the pinned message, which says:</p>
            <pre>hello,
you have to connect to the server with SSH (use putty or mobaxterm for example):
host : century.underthewire.tech
port : 22
For the credentials they are at the top of this chat
Username                  Password
---------                 ---------
century1                  century1
cyborg1                   cyborg1
groot1                    groot1
oracle1                   oracle1
trebek1                   trebek1</pre>
            <p>Now we can enter the level with the SSH command and the password, and we are greeted by the windows powershell message:</p>
            <pre>C:\Users\shukularuni\Documents&gt;ssh cyborg1@cyborg.underthewire.tech -p 22
cyborg1@cyborg.underthewire.tech's password: cyborg1
