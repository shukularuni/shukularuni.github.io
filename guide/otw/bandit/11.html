            <pre>Description: The password for the next level is stored in the file data.txt, which contains base64 encoded data
Commands: grep, sort, uniq, strings, base64, tr, tar, gzip, bzip2, xxd
Sources: <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64">Base64 on Wikipedia</a>.</pre>
            <h2>Theory</h2>
            <p>To get the password, the instructions say that it's inside a file which is encoded in Base64. This is pretty easy because, you could go to any online Base64 Decoder, and it will work. But for the purposes of doing this level the right way, it's actually simpler than you think. I'll give you a quick explanation of Base64: it is a way to encode text or binary data to just text with the characters from the alphabet letters&mdash;both uppercase and lowercase&mdash;, numbers 0 to 9, and the symbols +, /, and =. Then those binary texts convert into binary zeros and ones, and with a little of math, any binary character that exists has a value between 1 and 64, this is where the letters, numbers, and symbols come in, depending on the 1-64 value you get, it will be one of the characters from before, so if the value from the binary character is 3 and 59, it will come out as C7 (ususally you cannot fit more than 4 thousand characters into a group of 64, so each character can become two or three from it's original form, but still maintaining the same data), then all of the base64 values that we get are joined into a single string. What we are doing here, is the inverse of the explanation, which is as easy as it is to encode. If you didn't realize it yet, the command we'll use is "base64", which if you look through its manual page, the command will encode in Base64 whatever text or file you want, but that is encode, we want to decode, so that's why we'll use the -d option, which literally just stands for decode. After that we pluck the filename at the end and we get this command:</p>
            <pre>base64 -d data.txt</pre>
            <p>If you want to know more about this, check out <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64" target="_blank">this Wikipedia article</a>.</p>
            <h2>Solution</h2>
            <p>For example, if we just use cat for the file it will have an equal sign at the end, which is a really straightforward indication that it's Base64 encoded:</p>
            <pre>~$ cat data.txt
VGhlIHBhc3N3b3JkIGlzICMjI1JFREFDVEVEIyMjCgpZb3UgcmVhbGx5IHRob3VnaHQKCj46Mw==</pre>
            <p>Now you just have to get into the level and do the command:</p>
            <pre>~$ base64 -d data.txt
The password is Bs6Tmc8QChGv9uHys5wZ8MtqZ3W1KmFv</pre>
            <p>And that's it, it worked! Now we should be good to go to the next level.</p>
