            <h2>Access</h2>
            <p>SSH: <code>ssh bandit1@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220</code></p>
            <p>Password: <code>fzRysGa0Ueo64hZsZRWD5cEyb301wABm</code></p>
            <h2>Info</h2>
            <pre>Description: The password for the next level is stored in a file called - located in the home directory
Commands: ls, cd, cat, file, du, find</pre>
            <h2>Theory</h2>
            <p>To get the password, the instructions say that there's a file called "-" that has the password. I'd guess from the manual, that the it will pick this up as an option (or flag) instead of as a file name. So what we would need to do to get the password is put "./" before the file name to specify that it's a file located in "./".</p>
            <h2>Solution</h2>
            <p>So, using the info from our theory, first we look at the folder:</p>
            <pre>~$ ls
-</pre>
            <p>And of course the name of the file is a single dash. I checked cat - just to be sure, and my terminal just crashed, so yeah, don't try it. Now we try using ./ before the filename:</p>
            <pre>~$ cat ./-
gTSrLU45901yl2RcmpaySeLGyyrf2Gfs</pre>
            <p>And it works, now that we've got the password, use exit to logout and go to the next level.</p>
