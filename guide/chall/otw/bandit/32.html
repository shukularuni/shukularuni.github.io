            <h2>Access</h2>
            <p>SSH: <code>ssh bandit31@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220</code></p>
            <p>Password: <code>5rdWnMsS81Zw9mpruSVu3yDpmA4AtqMN</code></p>
            <h2>Info</h2>
            <pre>There is a git repository at ssh://bandit31-git@localhost/home/bandit31-git/repo via the port 2220. The password for the user bandit31-git is the same as for the user bandit31. Clone the repository and find the password for the next level.
Commands: git</pre>
            <h2>Theory</h2>
            <p>To get the password, the instructions say to clone the repository and look for the password there. So, I already explained this in the last last last last level, and the instructions don't give much more insight into what the level will be, so here's the commands again:</p>
            <pre>git clone ssh://bandit31-git@localhost/home/bandit31-git/repo
git clone ssh://bandit31-git@localhost:2220/home/bandit31-git/repo</pre>
            <h2>Solution</h2>
            <p>Same thing as last last last last level:</p>
            <pre>~$ mktemp -d
/tmp/tmp.l4qp0UuySA

~$ cd /tmp/tmp.l4qp0UuySA

/tmp/tmp.l4qp0UuySA$ git clone ssh://bandit31-git@localhost:2220/home/bandit31-git/repo
...
Receiving objects: 100% (4/4), done.</pre>
            <p>Now that we have the repository, let's look what's inside:</p>
            <pre>/tmp/tmp.l4qp0UuySA$ ls
repo

/tmp/tmp.l4qp0UuySA$ cd repo

/tmp/tmp.l4qp0UuySA/repo$ ls -la
total 20
drwxrwxr-x 3 bandit31 bandit31 4096 Jan  7 15:26 .
drwx------ 3 bandit31 bandit31 4096 Jan  7 15:26 ..
drwxrwxr-x 8 bandit31 bandit31 4096 Jan  7 15:26 .git
-rw-rw-r-- 1 bandit31 bandit31    6 Jan  7 15:26 .gitignore
-rw-rw-r-- 1 bandit31 bandit31  147 Jan  7 15:26 README.md

/tmp/tmp.l4qp0UuySA/repo$ cat README.md
This time your task is to push a file to the remote repository.

Details:
    File name: key.txt
    Content: 'May I come in?'
    Branch: master</pre>
            <p>So it tells us that we have to push a file into the remote repo named "key.txt" with that content in the master branch:</p>
            <pre>/tmp/tmp.l4qp0UuySA/repo$ echo 'May I come in?' > key.txt

/tmp/tmp.l4qp0UuySA/repo$ cat .gitignore
*.txt</pre>
            <p>The problem is that the gitignore file has any file that ends with ".txt", which means that it won't let you push files that have this extension. Although, we can override this by just pushing with git add, then commit. And because it's a commit, nano will expect a message coming with the commit, however, the message doen't impact, you can put whatever you want, for example, I put "File with text in it lol" lol:</p>
            <pre>/tmp/tmp.l4qp0UuySA/repo$ git commit -a
