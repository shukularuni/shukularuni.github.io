            <h2>Access</h2>
            <p>SSH: <code>ssh bandit7@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220</code></p>
            <p>Password: <code>xkO4Hz3ks0FEB9dLOlZKicb2NtW2OL27</code></p>
            <h2>Info</h2>
            <pre>Description: The password for the next level is stored in the file data.txt next to the word millionth
Commands: man, grep, sort, uniq, strings, base64, tr, tar, gzip, bzip2, xxd</pre>
            <h2>Theory</h2>
            <p>To get the password, the instructions say that it's inside a file next to the word millionth. We can assume from this that there's a bunch of lines with random words next to random passwords that don't work except for one line that has the word millionth next to the real password, then looking through the manual (which now we don't have the links for it so that we use the command "man #command#" and if you change #command# for a real command it will be like if you were on the manual page, but it's inside the console/terminal) aka "man grep" would be the command, in here we can see that it does exactly what we need, just put grep, then the word/pattern you want to find, and finally in which file, or don't specify filename to find it in all files of the current directory. So, with all of this we get:</p>
            <pre>grep millionth data.txt</pre>
            <h2>Solution</h2>
            <p>Now you just have to get into the level and do the command:</p>
            <pre>~$ grep millionth data.txt
millionth       lluKkeJYKiGSwBDlAetZmv6JYgpIGfK8</pre>
            <p>And that's our password! Now you can exit and go to the next level.</p>
