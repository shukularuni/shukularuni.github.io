Score: 2
Description: You are now becoming a linux superhacker.

Create an SSH account with the form below.
Then enter the 6 solutions to level 0-5 separated by comma.
Example: bitwarrior,Solution1,Solution2,Solution3,Solution4,Solution5

Proudly presented by the The Warchall(tm) Staff
Thanks and shouts to xd-- for idea, motivation and inspiration!</pre>
            <h2>Theory</h2>
            <p>To get the full answer with all 6 solutions, first we need to put a secure password on the form below the description, it doesn't necessarily have to be your account password. Then you have to run the command you get in your terminal, I don't know what we'll find in the SSH, so let's enter already.</p>
            <h2>Solution</h2>
            <p>So if we enter and check the files, we see this welcoming file:</p>
            <pre>~$ ls
WELCOME.md  level  www  www_access.log  www_error.log

~$ cat WELCOME.md
Welcome, challenger to warchall.net.

We hope to be able to present some more realistic challenges in a safe (or not so safe environment) and hope you will like the project!

You will find the solution to each level in
/home/level
or
/home/user/yournick/level

            <p>Alright, let's go to the level folder and check the first:</p>
            <pre>~$ cd /home/level

/home/level$ ls
00_welcome      05_privacy            12_pytong    level01
01_choice_tree  07_tropical_fruits    14_live_fi   matrixman
02              08_sshz               15_live_rfi  special
03              10_choose_your_path   20_live_rce
04_kwisatz      11_choose_your_path2  21_nurxxed

/home/level$ cd 00_welcome

/home/level/00_welcome$ ls
README.md

/home/level/00_welcome$ cat README.md

Oh .... and your solution to level0 is: "bitwarrior" without the quotes.

 - The WarChall Staff</pre>
            <p>Okay that is the first solution, now let's go to the next:</p>
            <pre>/home/level/00_welcome$ cd ../01_choice_tree

/home/level/01_choice_tree$ ls
README.md  blue  green  red

/home/level/01_choice_tree$ cat README.md
Hello Hacker,

You do not need to read this.
good luck!</pre>
            <p>It seems there are various folders, and opening that blue one just opens up to another folder, so i'm going to look at all the folders recursively to check anything inside of these repeating folders. And we can see there is a file called `SOLUTION.txt`, so let's check that:</p>
            <pre>home/level/01_choice_tree$ ls -R
.:
README.md  blue  green  red

./blue:
hats

./blue/hats:
black  grey  white

./blue/hats/black:
jedi.md

./blue/hats/black/jedi.md:
sith.md

./blue/hats/black/jedi.md/sith.md:
PATH.path

./blue/hats/grey:
solution

./blue/hats/grey/solution:
patience

./blue/hats/grey/solution/patience:
SOLUTION.txt

./blue/hats/white:
README.EXE

./green:
README.md

./red:
you.die

/home/level/01_choice_tree$ cat blue/hats/grey/solution/patience/SOLUTION.txt 
This was just a little warmup.
The solution to level 1 is "patience" without the quotes.</pre>
            <p>Level 1 is done, let's go to the next:</p>
            <pre>/home/level/01_choice_tree$ cd ../02

/home/level/02$ ls
documents  photos

/home/level/02$ ls documents
letter.txt

/home/level/02$ ls photos
thumbnails

/home/level/02$ cat documents/letter.txt 
Hey Jerry, I have sent you a letter.

Greetings
level02

/home/level/02$ cat photos/thumbnails
Super OS Thumbs v8.0
Nothing here yet</pre>
            <p>Hmm, there's nothing important here, let's try searching for hidden files:</p>
            <pre>/home/level/02$ ls -a
.  ..  .porb  documents  photos

/home/level/02$ cd .porb

/home/level/02/.porb$ ls -a
.  ..  .solution

/home/level/02/.porb$ cat .solution
The solution is HiddenIsConfig</pre>
            <p>There we go, that's 3 of 6. Let's continue with level3:</p>
            <pre>/home/level/02/.porb$ cd ../../03

/home/level/03$ ls

/home/level/03$ ls -a
.  ..  .bash_history  .local

/home/level/03$ cat .bash_history
The solution to SSH3 is: RepeatingHistory
ls
whoami
exit
ls
ls -asl
nano .bash_history
ls -asl
cat .bash_history
ls -asl</pre>
            <p>Okay, that was weirdly easy... Anyways that's the solution of Level3, now let's go to the fourth:</p>
            <pre>/home/level/03$ cd ../04_kwisatz/

/home/level/04_kwisatz$ ls
README.nfo

/home/level/04_kwisatz$ cat README.nfo
Look in your ~

/home/level/04_kwisatz$ ls ~/level
04_kwisatz

/home/level/04_kwisatz$ ls ~/level/04_kwisatz 
README.txt  README2.md

/home/level/04_kwisatz$ cat ~/level/04_kwisatz/README.txt
Dear Future Hacker,

I wrote you an important message in README2.md
Please act accordingly.

 The WarChall Staff 2023!

/home/level/04_kwisatz$ cat ~/level/04_kwisatz/README2.md
# Congratulations!

Dear Challenger,

WarChall got erased once,
hence, the original message is lost.

I think kwisatz wanted to say:

Hey there, welcome to wechall!

 - kwisatz


## Flag

Your flag is: "AndOfCourseIDoKnowChown" without the quotes.</pre>
            <p>We have the fifth piece of the answer, now let's go to level5 to get the sixth and final:</p>
            <pre>/home/level/04_kwisatz$ cd ../05_privacy/

/home/level/05_privacy$ ls
README.md

/home/level/05_privacy$ cat README.md 
# WAR#5: Privacy

Please protect your ~ from any other people than yourself.

Then run ./checker

( This does not work again yet. It would check and say the solution. )

The 5th solution is "OKPRIVATE" without the quotes.


 - The WeChall Staff</pre>
            <p>Well, I have no clue where to find this `checker` program, but it did already give us the solution, so I'm not going to question anything. Now that we have all the solutions we can put them all in one string separated by commas (no spaces) and submit our answer:</p>
            <pre>bitwarrior,patience,HiddenIsConfig,RepeatingHistory,AndOfCourseIDoKnowChown,OKPRIVATE</pre>
            <p>There we go! That's the solution.</p>
            <p>I voted this level as:</p>
