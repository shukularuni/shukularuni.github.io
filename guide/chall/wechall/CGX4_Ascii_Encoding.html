Description: Hello future Hackers,

We have created the next lesson.
This time we talk about ascii encoding.
Again, the challenge is more informative and gives no points.

Happy Challenging!

This lesson has an interactive problem:

72 101 108 108 111 32 115 104 117 107 117 108 97 114 117 110 105 46 32 83 111 108 117 116 105 111 110 58 32 122 79 120 54 89 112 70 121

The problem is randomly generated and is bound to your session.

Good Luck!

            <h2>Theory</h2>
            <p>So this one's a little problem of ascii encoding, it's something we've seen before. It's a table that contains all the characters and numbers them, now the columns are ways to represent these characters, it can be HTML entities, in decimal, hexadecimal, octal, etc. Now as you saw me point out, yes decimal, basically the normal number that represents each character, this is what we are seeing in the problem above, so now that we know that it's decimal, we can search online for a converter. One that converts from decimal to text. Also, don't copy my solution, as you might see in a moment, it's a password made for my user and session, and for privacy purposes, I have changed the password to one I randomly generated a minute ago.</p>
            <h2>Solution</h2>
            <p>Put the values in the online converter:</p>
            <pre>DECIMAL TO TEXT (online converter)

INPUT: 72 101 108 108 111 32 115 104 117 107 117 108 97 114 117 110 105 46 32 83 111 108 117 116 105 111 110 58 32 122 79 120 54 89 112 70 121

OUTPUT: Hello shukularuni. Solution: zOx6YpFy</pre>
            <p>Now let's check that password they've made just for me:</p>
