            <h2>Training: Math Pyramid</h2>
            <pre>Name: Training: Math Pyramid
Tags: Math, Training
Score: 2
Description: This is the first release of a math challenge.
You have to come up with the shortest solution (9 chars or less) for a geometric function.
And the story goes like:

Pharao momo wants a square-based pyramid, where all the eight edges are of the same length 'a'.
Please support him with a formula to calculate the volume for a given side length.
Your co-workers already drew a sketch how the pyramid looks like from front-view:

[pyramid.png]

Example Formula: a^3/3*sqrt(a*a)
Notation Hints: sqrt(), a^2, etc.

Enjoy!

Thanks go out to momo for the idea, Jinx for testing, paipai for a copy of EvalMath and Miles Kaufmann for writing the EvalMath class.</pre>
            <h2>Theory</h2>
            <p>To get the solution, as the description says, we'll have to do some math to solve this challenge. We have a square-based pyramid where every base edge has length `a`, every side (slanted) edge also has length `a`, so total edges = 8 meaning they're all equal. And that forces the apex to be directly above the center of the square, otherwise some edges would be longer. So let's try solving a formula for this pyramid.</p>
            <h2>Solution</h2>
            <p>The base is a square with side length of `a`, so the diagonal is like this:</p>
            <img src="https://archive.org/download/sh_w_imgstff_fgunp/wechall/Training_Math_Pyramid/1.png">
            <p>And the distance from center to a corner is half the diagonal, this will be one leg of the pyramid:</p>
            <img src="https://archive.org/download/sh_w_imgstff_fgunp/wechall/Training_Math_Pyramid/2.png">
            <p>Now we'll find the height by Pythagoras:</p>
            <img src="https://archive.org/download/sh_w_imgstff_fgunp/wechall/Training_Math_Pyramid/3.png">
            <p>So just substitute `r` with the one we already have:</p>
            <img src="https://archive.org/download/sh_w_imgstff_fgunp/wechall/Training_Math_Pyramid/4.png">
            <p>And finally, simplify</p>
            <img src="https://archive.org/download/sh_w_imgstff_fgunp/wechall/Training_Math_Pyramid/5.png"><br>

            <img src="https://archive.org/download/sh_w_imgstff_fgunp/wechall/Training_Math_Pyramid/7.png">
            <p>Now we'll calculate the volume of the pyramid with the general formula:</p>
            <img src="https://archive.org/download/sh_w_imgstff_fgunp/wechall/Training_Math_Pyramid/8.png">
            <p>Input in the formula the base (side is `a` so `a &#xB7; a` is `a&sup2;`) and the height we just got:</p>
            <img src="https://archive.org/download/sh_w_imgstff_fgunp/wechall/Training_Math_Pyramid/9.png">
            <p>Multiply the three, and we have a formula ready:</p>
            <img src="https://archive.org/download/sh_w_imgstff_fgunp/wechall/Training_Math_Pyramid/10.png">
            <pre>a^3/3*sqrt(2)</pre>
            <p>Now all we have to do now is try to make this formula into 9 characters, because right now it's 13. We can rewrite the square root below to save some space:</p>
            <img src="https://archive.org/download/sh_w_imgstff_fgunp/wechall/Training_Math_Pyramid/11.png">
            <p>And entering that into our equation, it saves a whopping *one* character:</p>
            <img src="https://archive.org/download/sh_w_imgstff_fgunp/wechall/Training_Math_Pyramid/12.png">
            <pre>a^3/sqrt(18)</pre>
            <p>Now because 12 is still bigger than 9, we have to find another way to gain more space. So if we rewrite the square root to be a one half exponent (it's the same as a square root), I think we can save a bit more space:</p>
            <img src="https://archive.org/download/sh_w_imgstff_fgunp/wechall/Training_Math_Pyramid/13.png">
            <p>And so, if we plug in that into our volume formula, we get exactly 9 characters:</p>
            <img src="https://archive.org/download/sh_w_imgstff_fgunp/wechall/Training_Math_Pyramid/14.png">
            <pre>a^3/18^.5</pre>
            <p>There we go! That's the solution.</p>
            <p>I voted this level as:</p>
