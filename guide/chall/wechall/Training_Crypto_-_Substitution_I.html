Description: Oh dear, I guess you have cracked the two caesar cryptos...
This one is more difficult. Although a simple substitution is easily cracked...
Again the characters are limited to A-Z... But I think I can come up with a 256 version again.

Enjoy!

            <h2>Theory</h2>
            <p>To get the solution, as the description says, we have to decode this weird string. Because they mentioned substitution ciphers, and the challenge is literally named Substitution 1, we'll obviously have to decode this with via a substitution cipher. Usually this type of cipher is solved by looking at the letter density and guessing which swapped letters are which, but I do know a little website that I've used for some time now that is really good at density mapping letters of the alphabet on their Substitution Solver page. So we'll copy the given string and put it in the page.</p>
            <h2>Solution</h2>
            <p>So let's check what the message might be with the solver:</p>
