Description: In this training challenge you have to reveal a hidden message inside another message.
It is known that the message is hidden via Bacon cipher.

Again the solution changes for every session and consists of 12 random characters.

Enjoy!

            <h2>Theory</h2>
            <p>To get the solution, as the description says, we have to decode this giant block of text. And as it is probably so painfully obvious, is that there's something to do with the caps on the letters, because the Bacon Cipher is mentioned in the description and is part of the title. So I think a simple python code should help us get, for example, A's from uppercase letters, and B's from lowercase, and just skip whatever isn't a letter:</p>
            <pre>''.join('A' if i.isalpha() and i.isupper() else ('B' if i.isalpha() and i.islower() else '') for i in txt)</pre>
            <h2>Solution</h2>
            <p>So if we run this code with the giant block of text as a 'txt' variable, we get this:</p>

            <p>Hmm, no that doesn't seem to be a language and it does have missing characters. Let's try swapping A and B, so now it's B and A:</p>

            <p>Oh, wait no. When the question marks appear, it means that it's in the full 26 character alphabet where I-J and U-V aren't classified as the same bacon code:</p>

            <p>And it seems we have some english here, so let me clear it up a little by clearing the majority of the text and the X's that act as spaces:</p>
