            <h2>Theory</h2>
            <p>To get the solution, as the description says, we have to search through the page's source code, or View Source. To go into view source and see the source code of the page you can do it through right-click and View Source or Ctrl+U. Now let's go into the view source and look for the solution in there.</p>
